    "We are going to use a toy example to familiarise the user with the basic functionality of BioCypher. One central task of BioCypher is the harmonisation of dissimilar datasets describing the same entities. Thus, in this example, the input data - which in the real-world use case could come from any type of interface - are represented by simulated data containing some examples of differently formatted biomedical entities such as proteins and their interactions.\n",

The first uses a CSV output format to write files suitable for Neo4j admin import, and the second creates an in-memory collection of Pandas dataframes.
